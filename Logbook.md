# Shoulder formation in DN and dependence on SP distance
---

## Motivation

The shoulder in the density profiles is related to detachment state of the outer divertor.

## Shotlist

The main proposal for these discharges is from MST1 2017, HLT21.
Some other discharges are added to complement the database.
