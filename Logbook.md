# Shoulder formation in DN and dependence on SP distance
---

## Motivation

The shoulder in the density profiles is related to detachment state of the outer divertor.

## Shotlist

The main proposal for these discharges is from MST1 2017, HLT21.
Some other discharges are added to complement the database.

## Langmuir probe data and magnetic configuration

The temperature profile at both targets seems to be also dependent on magnetic configuration.

At this point, I'm stumbled. This is the only good example I have seen so far.
